# NIP-61: Nut-Zaps
`optional`

Nut-zaps are Pay-To-Pubkey (P2PK) [Cashu](https://cashu.space) tokens, where the payment itself serves as the receipt. This approach improves and simplifies the process compared to [NIP-57](57.md) *Lightning Zaps*.

## Nut-Zap Informational Event

The `kind:10019` event allows others to understand how to send nut-zaps to a user.

```jsonc
{
    "kind": 10019,
    "tags": [
        [ "relay", "wss://relay1" ],
        [ "relay", "wss://relay2" ],
        [ "mint", "https://mint1", "usd", "sat" ],
        [ "mint", "https://mint2", "sat" ],
        [ "pubkey", "<p2pk-pubkey>" ]
    ]
}
```

### Tags
- `relay`: Specifies the relays where the user will read nut-zap events. A user sending a nup-zap **MUST** write to these relays. *(required)*
- `mint`: Lists the mints that the user has explicitly agreed to use for receiving funds. Clients **MUST NOT** send funds to mints not listed here, as doing so may result in a loss of funds. Additional markers in the mint tag can indicate the supported base units (e.g., "usd", "sat"). *(required)*
- `pubkey`: The public key that **MUST** be used to P2PK-lock any received nut-zaps. If this key is not specified, clients **MUST** use the recipient’s primary public key instead. For more details, see [Appendix 1: Alternative P2PK Pubkey](#appendix-1-alternative-p2pk-pubkey). *(optional)*

## Nut-Zap Event

A `kind:9321` event represents a nut-zap transaction, published by the sender and tagged with the recipient’s public key. The transaction outputs are P2PK-locked to the public key specified by the recipient in their `kind:10019` event or, if not specified, to the recipient's default public key.

To ensure compatibility with Cashu, clients **MUST** prefix the P2PK-locked public key with `"02"`.

Clients **SHOULD** include a Discrete Log Equality (DLEQ) proof within the nut-zap event. This allows the verification of nut-zaps without requiring direct requests to the mint.

```jsonc
{
    "kind": 9321,
    "content": "Thanks for this great idea.",
    "pubkey": "<sender-pubkey>",
    "tags": [
        [ "amount", "1" ],
        [ "unit", "sat" ],
        [ "proof", "{\"amount\":1,\"C\":\"02277c66191736eb72fce9d975d08e3191f8f96afb73ab1eec37e4465683066d3f\",\"id\":\"000a93d6f8a1d2c4\",\"secret\":\"[\\\"P2PK\\\",{\\\"nonce\\\":\\\"b00bdd0467b0090a25bdf2d2f0d45ac4e355c482c1418350f273a04fedaaee83\\\",\\\"data\\\":\\\"02eaee8939e3565e48cc62967e2fde9d8e2a4b3ec0081f29eceff5c64ef10ac1ed\\\"}]\"}" ],
        [ "u", "https://stablenut.umint.cash" ],
        [ "e", "<zapped-event-id>", "<relay-hint>" ],
        [ "p", "e9fbced3a42dcf551486650cc752ab354347dd413b307484e4fd1818ab53f991" ] // recipient's public key
    ]
}
```

### Tags
- `content`: A message or comment associated with the nut-zap. *(optional)*
- `amount`: Represents the total amount of the transaction. Clients **SHOULD** verify that this value matches the combined total of the individual outputs. *(optional)*
- `unit`: The base unit of the amount (e.g., "sat"). *(required)*
- `proof`: Contains one or more proofs, P2PK-locked to the public key specified in the recipient's `kind:10019` event. *(required)*
- `u`: The *exact* URL of the mint, as specified by the recipient’s `kind:10019` event. *(required)*
- `e`: Reference to the event being nut-zapped, with an optional relay hint. *(optional)*
- `p`: The recipient’s public key indicating the nut-zap’s destination. *(required; exactly one)*

## Flow

### Sending a Nut-Zap
- The sender fetches the recipient's `kind:10019`.
- The sender mints or swaps ecash on one of the recipient's listed mints to the specified p2pk pubkey.

### Receiving Nut-Zaps
Clients **SHOULD** REQ for `kind:9321` events with the following filters:
- `#u` for mints they expect to receive ecash from to prevent even interacting with mints the user hasn't explicitly signaled.
- `since` of the most recent `kind:7376` event the same user has created.

Clients **MAY** choose to filter to ignore spam (e.g., using web-of-trust).

`{ "kinds": [9321], "#p": "<my-pubkey>", "#u": [ "<mint-1>", "<mint-2>"], "since": <latest-created_at-of-kind-7376> }`.

Upon receiving a new nut-zap, the client **SHOULD** swap the proofs into a wallet the user controls. This **MAY** be a [NIP-60](60.md) wallet, another Cashu wallet, or a Lightning Network wallet.

## Nut-Zap Redemption

When a token is claimed, the client **SHOULD** create a `kind:7376` event as specified in [NIP-60](60.md). This event must include an `e` tag referencing the original nut-zap event, signaling that the token has been redeemed and providing proof to the recipient that the e-cash has been claimed.

It’s possible to tag multiple `kind:9321` nut-zap events within a single `kind:7376` redemption event.

Redemption events **SHOULD** be published to the sender’s relays, as specified by their [NIP-65](65.md) configuration.

### Example Event Structure
```jsonc
{
    "kind": 7376,
    "content": nip44_encrypt([
        [ "direction", "in" ], // "in" indicates received; "out" indicates sent
        [ "amount", "1", "sat" ],
        [ "e", "<7375-event-id>", "relay-hint", "created" ] // reference to the new token event created during redemption
    ]),
    "tags": [
        [ "a", "37375:<wallet-pubkey>:my-wallet" ], // optional wallet tag linking to a specific wallet
        [ "e", "<9321-event-id>", "<relay-hint>", "redeemed" ], // original nut-zap event being redeemed
        [ "p", "<sender-pubkey>" ] // public key of the nut-zap sender (author of the 9321 event)
    ]
}
```

## Additional Considerations

- Clients **SHOULD** guide users to select NUT-11 (P2PK)-compatible mints in their `kind:10019` event to prevent receiving nut-zaps that others could potentially spend.
- Clients **SHOULD** normalize and deduplicate mint URLs as outlined in [NIP-65](65.md).
- Nut-zaps **MUST** be sent only to a mint listed in the recipient’s `kind:10019` event or to the recipient’s relays defined by NIP-65. Failure to do so may result in the recipient inadvertently donating tokens to the mint, as they may never receive the nut-zap event.

## Appendix 1: Alternative P2PK Public Key

In cases where clients **MAY NOT** have access to the user’s private key (e.g., when using NIP-07 or NIP-46 for signing), the private key needed to spend incoming P2PK nut-zaps may not be available, potentially preventing the user from spending these tokens.

To address this, clients can take the following actions:
1. **Add a `pubkey` tag** to the user’s `kind:10019` event, specifying the public key to which senders should P2PK-lock tokens.
2. **Store the private key** in the `kind:37375` event, encrypted in the `content` field as per [NIP-44](44.md).

This approach avoids reliance on NIP-07/46 adaptations for signing Cashu payloads, ensuring clients can handle P2PK transactions securely.
