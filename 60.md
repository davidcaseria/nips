# NIP-60: Cashu Wallet
`optional`

This NIP defines the operations of a [Cashu](https://cashu.space) wallet.

A Cashu wallet stores e-cash proofs in relays to make it accessible across applications.

The purpose of this NIP is:
- *Ease-of-Use*: new users can immediately receive funds without creating accounts with other services.
- *Interoperability*: users' wallets follow them across applications.

This NIP does **not** deal with a user receiving money from someone else; its purpose is to keep track of a user's wallet state.

## Event Kinds
- `kind:37375` contains relevant info for a wallet. Clients **SHOULD** check the current info event when loading the wallet.
- `kind:7374` tracks pending quotes from a mint. This event **MAY** be used to keep track of the quote ID and its expiration.
- `kind:7375` represents the wallet's unspent proofs. The proofs **MUST** be encrypted with the user's private key.
- `kind:7376` provides the wallet's transaction history. The history **SHOULD** be provided to prevent a user from double-spending e-cash.

## Wallet Informational Event
```jsonc
{
    "kind": 37375,
    "content": nip44_encrypt([
        [ "balance", "100", "sat" ],
        [ "privkey", "<hexkey>" ], // explained in NIP-61
        [ "connection", "<nip-47-secret-hexkey>", "<used-budget>", "<budget-renewal-period>", "<budget-renews-at>" ], // budget optional
    ]),
    "tags": [
        [ "d", "my-wallet" ],
        [ "mint", "https://mint1" ],
        [ "mint", "https://mint2" ],
        [ "mint", "https://mint3" ],
        [ "name", "my shitposting wallet" ],
        [ "unit", "sat" ],
        [ "description", "a wallet for my day-to-day shitposting" ],
        [ "relay", "wss://relay1" ],
        [ "relay", "wss://relay2" ],
    ]
}
```

The wallet event is a parameterized replaceable event `kind:37375`.

### Tags:
- `d` - A unique identifier for the wallet. *(required)*
- `mint` - Lists the mint(s) that this wallet uses. There **MUST** be at least one `mint` tag. *(required)*
- `relay` - Specifies the relays where the wallet and related events can be found. One or more relays **SHOULD** be specified. If no relay is specified, clients **SHOULD** use the default relays as defined in [NIP-65](65.md). *(optional)*
- `unit` - Defines the base unit of currency for the wallet (e.g., `"sat"`, `"usd"`).
- `name` - A human-readable name for the wallet. *(optional)*
- `description` - A human-readable description of the wallet. *(optional)*
- `balance` - An estimate of the wallet’s balance, which may serve as a placeholder until an accurate balance is calculated by fetching all unspent proofs. *(optional)*
- `privkey` - The private key used to unlock P2PK e-cash. This key **MUST** be encrypted in the `.content` field. **This private key is exclusively for the wallet and is not associated with the user's Nostr private key.** It is only required when receiving funds, as described in [NIP-61](61.md). *(optional)*
- `connection` - [NIP-47](47.md) connection details for the wallet. *(optional)*

- Any tag, except for `d`, **MAY** be [NIP-44](44.md) encrypted into the `.content` field.

### Deleting a Wallet Event
Due to the difficulty in deleting paramaterized replaceable events, an empty event **SHOULD** be signed with the `d` identifier and a `deleted` tag.

## Proof Event

Proof events are used to store the unspent proofs held by a wallet.

There can be multiple `kind:7375` events for the same mint, and multiple proofs inside each event.

```jsonc
{
    "kind": 7375,
    "content": nip44_encrypt({
        "mint": "https://stablenut.umint.cash",
        "proofs": [
            {
                "id": "005c2502034d4f12",
                "amount": 1,
                "secret": "z+zyxAVLRqN9lEjxuNPSyRJzEstbl69Jc1vtimvtkPg=",
                "C": "0241d98a8197ef238a192d47edf191a9de78b657308937b4f7dd0aa53beae72c46"
            }
        ]
    }),
    "tags": [
        [ "a", "37375:<wallet-pubkey>:my-wallet" ]
    ]
}
```

- `.content` is a [NIP-44](44.md) encrypted payload storing the mint and proofs.

### Tags:
- The `a` tag **SHOULD** be provided to link the token to a specific wallet.

### Spending Proofs
When one or more proofs in a proof event are spent, the event containing these proofs **SHOULD** be deleted using the [NIP-09](09.md) deletion process. If any proofs in this deleted event remain unspent, a new proof event **MUST** be created to carry over these unspent proofs and to add any new proofs.

Proofs included in a `kind:7376` event **SHOULD** be considered "reserved," meaning they are not available to be spent. Once a proof has been verified as spent by the mint, it **SHOULD** be removed from proof events.

## Transaction Event

Clients **SHOULD** publish `kind:7376` events to create a transaction history when the wallet's balance changes.

```jsonc
{
    "kind": 7376,
    "content": nip44_encrypt([
        [ "direction", "in" ], // in = received, out = sent
        [ "amount", "1", "sat" ],
        [ "price", "70000.00", "usd" ]
        [ "e", "<proofs-event>", "<relay-hint>", "created" ],
    ]),
    "tags": [
        [ "a", "37375:<wallet-pubkey>:my-wallet" ],
    ]
}
```

- `.content` is a [NIP-44](44.md) encrypted payload storing the transaction information.

### Tags
- `direction`: Indicates the transaction direction. Use `in` for received funds and `out` for sent funds. *(required)*
- `amount`: Specifies the transaction amount. *(required)*
- `price`: The price of the transaction in a fiat currency. *(optional)*
- `e`: The event ID of the proof event associated with this transaction, whether created or reserved. **Note**: Refer to the [Proof Event Reference Tags](#proof-event-reference-tags) section for more details. *(required)*
- `a`: Links the token to a specific wallet. *(optional)*

All tags **SHOULD** be encrypted according to [NIP-44](44.md), with the following exceptions:
- The `a` tag **MUST** remain unencrypted.
- `e` tags marked with `redeemed` **SHOULD** remain unencrypted.

#### Proof Event Reference Tags
Clients **MUST** use `e` tags to reference proof events, marking each tag according to its purpose:
- `created`: Indicates that a new proofs event was created.
- `reserved`: Indicates that one or more proofs in the event were reserved.
- `redeemed`: Indicates that a redemption occurred (see [NIP-61: Nutzap Redemption](61.md#nut-zap-redemption)).

When receiving a token, a client **SHOULD** add three `e` tags to the transaction event:
  1. One for creating the token proofs.
  2. One for reserving the token proofs.
  3. One for creating the swapped proofs.

Additionally, a client **SHOULD** check the status of reserved proofs and **SHOULD** delete proof events marked as spent by the mint using [NIP-09](09.md) deletion. 

## Quote Event
Clients are encouraged to use local state when possible, but **MAY** publish this event when it makes sense in the context of the application.

When creating a quote at a mint, an event can be used to keep the state of the quote ID, which will be used to check when the quote has been paid. These events **SHOULD** be created with an expiration tag [NIP-40](40.md) matching the expiration of the bolt11 received from the mint; this signals to relays when they can safely discard these events.


```jsonc
{
    "kind": 7374,
    "content": nip44_encrypt("quote-id"),
    "tags": [
        [ "expiration", "<expiration-timestamp>" ],
        [ "mint", "<mint-url>" ],
        [ "a", "37375:<wallet-pubkey>:my-wallet" ]
    ]
}
```

## Flow

To retrieve a user’s wallet information, the client should initially check for `kind:10019` events from the user's relays. If no such event is found, the client **SHOULD** fall back to using the user’s relays as specified in [NIP-65](65.md).

### Fetch Wallet Events
The client **SHOULD** fetch wallet and proof events from the user's relays. If no wallet event is found, the client **SHOULD** create a new wallet event.

Use the following parameters to specify the kind and author:

`{ "kinds": [37375, 7375], "authors": ["<wallet-pubkey>"] }`

### Fetch Proofs and Transaction History
While fetching proofs, the client **MAY** use the optional `balance` tag in the wallet event to display an estimated wallet balance.

After retrieving the proofs, the client **SHOULD** fetch the transaction history, limiting the number of transactions.

`{ "kinds": [7376], "authors": ["<wallet-pubkey>"], "limit": 100 }`

For transaction events linked to proof events, these proofs **SHOULD** be considered reserved. The client **SHOULD** check the status of these proofs and delete any that are marked as spent. If any proofs appear in multiple events without a corresponding transaction event, the client **MAY** swap these proofs with the mint.


### Spending
Alice spends 4 sats from this proofs event:
```jsonconc
{
    "kind": 7375,
    "id": "event-id-1",
    "content": nip44_encrypt({
        "mint": "https://stablenut.umint.cash",
        "proofs": [
            { "id": "1", "amount": 1 },
            { "id": "2", "amount": 2 },
            { "id": "3", "amount": 4 },
            { "id": "4", "amount": 8 },
        ]
    }),
    "tags": [
        [ "a", "37375:<wallet-pubkey>:my-wallet" ]
    ]
}
```

Alice's client 
1. **MUST** rollover the unspent proofs
```jsonconc
{
    "kind": 7375,
    "id": "event-id-2",
    "content": nip44_encrypt({
        "mint": "https://stablenut.umint.cash",
        "proofs": [
            { "id": "1", "amount": 1 },
            { "id": "2", "amount": 2 },
            { "id": "4", "amount": 8 },
        ]
    }),
    "tags": [
        [ "a", "37375:<wallet-pubkey>:my-wallet" ]
    ]
}
```
2. **MUST** [NIP-09](09.md) delete event `event-id-1`
3. **SHOULD** create a `kind:7376` event to record the spend
```jsonconc
{
    "kind": 7376,
    "content": nip44_encrypt([
        [ "direction", "out" ],
        [ "amount", "4", "sats" ],
        [ "e", "<event-id-1>", "<relay-hint>", "destroyed" ],
        [ "e", "<event-id-2>", "<relay-hint>", "created" ],
    ]),
    "tags": [
        [ "a", "37375:<wallet-pubkey>:my-wallet" ],
    ]
}
```

## Appendix 1: Key Derivation

For enhanced privacy, password-protection, and shared account support, the wallet’s private key **MAY** be derived from the user’s Nostr private key. This derivation process **MUST** follow the key derivation method specified in [NIP-44](44.md).

The default wallet private key **SHOULD** be derived using a combination of the user’s Nostr private key, the user’s Nostr public key, and an empty password.

For shared account functionality, the public key **MUST** be the public key of the user with whom the wallet is shared.

Optionally, the wallet private key **MAY** be further secured by adding a password for additional protection.
